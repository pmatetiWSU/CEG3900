<p> Use your laptop or a PC while answering.  You are welcome to use
IdeaJ, and Android Studio + SDK tools, but <b>not</b> websites.  Apart
from these, this is a closed book, closed notes exam.  Do not give or
take help during the exam.  In particular, you are honor bound not to
Internet surf or access any content already existing (other than as
indicated) once you access the exam until you turnin the
<code>mtanswers.pdf</code>.  Please leave wide margins.</p>

<ol>

  <li>(5 points each) The following statements may or may not be
  (fully or partially) valid.  First, explain</i> the
  <u>underlined</u> technical term(s).  Then, explain/ discuss/
  dispute</i> the statement.  It is possible</i> to write, say, five,
  sentences each, and yet receive full score.  <ol type="i">

     <li> An <u>Android Activity</u> always runs in the background.</li>

     <li> Even though <u>Android SDK</u> is "complete", there is no
       command line program that lets you install, un-install, push
       and pull files on the virtual device -- you have to go to the
       GUI of the virtual device.

     <li> There cannot be an Android <u>app</u> that does not use any
     <u>permissions</u> whatsoever.

     <li> Every Android app must connect with a cloud <u>service</u>.

     <li> A <u>client</u> runs on the Android device, and
     a <u>server</u> runs on the PC.

   </ol>

  <li>
  (2*15 points) The AddDigits APK is aimed at children learning
  arithmetic.  It displays digits 0 - 9, as large images.  As each
  digit is pressed, it adds the digit to an ongoing sum, which starts
  out as 0.  (a) Give a detailed description of how you would design
  and build this APK.  Finished code is not expected, this being an
  exam, but do detail how the different pieces (Activities, Content
  Providers, Services, and Receivers) will work together. (b) Now,
  suggest changes so that the app is "faulty/ malicious": Every once
  in a while a wrong sum is computed.  This wrong summation may be
  obvious to adults.

  <li>(10 points each) Answer the following, at the level of Android
  app development details, Android internals, etc.
   
    <ol type="i">

      <li> Here is a link to <a href="anUnknown.apk">
          anUnknown.apk</a>.  What activities does it have? How did
          you discover? What is the best way to discover these?

      <li> Describe what an Android intent is.  Use examples.

      <li> TBD


      <li> TBD


      <li> TBD

        (0 points) [For survey purposes only.] Please record your
        effort in minutes for each of the above items. Other
        feedback you wish to give is also welcome.
